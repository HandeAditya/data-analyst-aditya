AWS Cloud Foundations – Learning Journey
This repository contains my notes and key takeaways from the AWS Cloud Foundations learning modules. Each section includes the key concepts I learned, labs I completed, and screenshots of knowledge check results and lab activities.

Module 1: Introduction to Cloud Concepts
In this module, I learned what cloud computing really means. I compared it to traditional computing and understood how cloud computing is more flexible, cost-effective, and scalable.

Key topics I learned:

The difference between On-Premise and Cloud Computing
Benefits of cloud: pay-as-you-go, scalability, global access
Introduction to IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS
Real-world examples of cloud usage

Module 2: AWS Core Services & Tools
In this part, I explored the basic services provided by AWS and how they help businesses manage their applications and data in the cloud.

Key things I learned:

EC2: Launching virtual servers
S3: Storing files and objects
RDS: Handling databases in the cloud
AWS Pricing Calculator: To estimate service costs
How to find support using AWS Support Plans

Module 3: Global Infrastructure & Networking
This module taught me how AWS works around the world using different Regions, Availability Zones, and Edge Locations.

I learned:

How AWS ensures availability through global infrastructure
The difference between a Region, AZ, and Edge Location
Why location of data centers matters for speed, privacy, and performance

Module 4: Security, Responsibility, and IAM
I learned how AWS keeps data secure and how security responsibilities are shared between AWS and users.

Key takeaways:

The Shared Responsibility Model
Creating and managing IAM users, groups, roles, and policies
Setting up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for stronger security
Lab Activity:
Created IAM roles and configured security policies.

Module 6: Serverless and AWS Lambda
In this module, I explored serverless computing using AWS Lambda, which allows running code without provisioning or managing servers.

Key learnings:

How Lambda works with events and triggers
Writing and deploying functions in the AWS Management Console
Example use cases to reduce cost and simplify development
Lab Activity:
Created and deployed Lambda functions.

Module 7: Containers and Amazon ECR
This module introduced me to containers and Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry).

What I gained:

Understanding of container technology and how it's different from VMs
How to push and pull images using ECR
Deployment basics for containerized apps
Lab Activity:
Worked with container registries and uploaded images.
